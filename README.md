TECHNOLOGY TO PREDICT NATURAL DISASTERS:
                              Almost every week there is news of another natural disaster.There is lot of loss to people and government.But natural disasters are outside the control of humans.The best thing humans can do is predicting natural disasters.
                              
                              Good predictions and warnings save lives. With only a few minutes' notice of a tornado or flash flood, people can act to protect themselves from injury and death. Predictions and warnings can also reduce damage and economic losses. When notice of an impending disaster can be issued well in advance, as it can for some riverine floods, wildfires, and hurricanes, property and natural resources can be protected.
